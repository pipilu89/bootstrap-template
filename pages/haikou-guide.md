                                and transport centre of the island and a major port. It is a relaxed
                                kind of place.
                                Expect long breaks around lunch time and for shops to be open till late
                                in the evening.
                                Indeed Haikou is perhaps at its most lively at 10pm in the evening with
                                many people
                                outside along the streets eating, drinking and shopping.

                                Haikou city has many faces: Palm tree lined streets; modern skyscraper
                                city scapes;
                                traditional chinese Hutongs; bustling fishing ports/markets; and long
                                beaches. As a
                                major city, it has all modern facilities including bars, night-clubs,
                                banks that accept
                                foreign cards, and good transport links.

                                Wonder along HaiDian river and see the local traditional wooden fishing
                                boats. Head to
                                the east end of the river at around 5pm to see the fish markets. The old
                                town centre
                                retains a fast disappearing part of Chinese history - the Hutong. Spend
                                an hour or 2

                                However, I consider these to be one of the charms of Haikou city. The

                                exist in the day time, but wait until the sun sets and the temperature
                                drops and at
                                around 9 o'clock in the evening certain streets will come alive with BBQ

                                To order food, look at what is on display and choose what you want. The
                                method works
                                even if your Chinese is limited. Here are some of my favourite Haikou
                                BBQ dishes:

                                - BBQ fish served with fresh small limes. (Mackerel pike fish, also
                                known as Pacific
                                saury, Chinese: 秋刀魚 Qiūdāoyú)
                                - Whole sweetcorn.
                                - Dried squid with wasabe and soy sauce.
                                - BBQ'ed oysters with garlic.
                                - Chicken wings.
                                - Local beer

                                The street BBQs are popular with local people and form part of the
                                Haikou nightlife.
                                Many locals drink beer and eat BBQ at these stalls until early morning.
                                Some of the
                                stalls are still open at 4am. It is normal to go eat at a BBQ after
                                leaving a nightclub
                                late at night before going home to sleep.

                                There are many BBQ stalls within walking distance of Haikou Banana
                                Hostel. Try the
                                corner of San Dong Lu and HaiDa Lu, or Er Dong Lu.

                                Here is a picture of the Muslim BBQ on Haidian Island, it is on the
                                corner of Haida Road

                                        avoid the mid-day heat and staying until after sunset. The central area

                                        at 28 RMB for the swimming pool. You need to pay a little bit more to
                                        use the

## Haikou Beaches

#### Holiday Beach (假日海滩 Jiàrì hǎitān)

To the west of Haikou city, Holiday Beach stretches for over 10km. This is the main beach in Haikou. In
the
summer we suggest visiting in the late afternoon to avoid the mid-day heat and staying until after
sunset. The
central area attracts a lot of locals in late afternoon, but it is easy to escape the crowds, if you
wish, by
walking a bit further down the beach.

You can swim in the sea and have a go on the jet-skis (15 minutes costs 70 rmb, though your probably
have to
haggle on the price).

In the main area of the beach there are outdoor street food stalls and places to buy drinks. There is a
nice new
swimming pool and hot spring, the price starts at 28 RMB for the swimming pool. You need to pay a little
bit
more to use the hot spring.

To the west of the main entrance there are volley ball nets and an outdoor BBQ area. Bring your own food
to the
BBQ. You pay around 50 RMB for charcoal and to use the one of the BBQ pits. The BBQ pits can be very
popular in
the evening with locals and can provide an atmospheric setting: with the smell of good food, many people
having
fun, and a nice sunset on the palm tree lined beach.

#### Xixiu Beach (西秀海滩 Xixiù hǎitān)

Closer to the west of Haikou city is Xixiu Beach, which 1-2km further west becomes Holiday Beach. The
Hainan
Windsurfing and Sailing Association has equipment for rent on Xixiu Beach.

#### Baishamen Beach (白沙门海滩 Báishāmén hǎitān)

On the north coast of Haidian Island (in the north of Haikou, near to the Haikou Banana Hostel) is
Baishamen
Park and Beach. The beach is about 1km long and next to where part of the Nandu River reaches the sea.
The area
was re-landscaped in 2010-2011.

#### Guilinyang Beach (桂林洋海滩 Guìlínyáng hǎitān)

To the east of Haikou is the beach area of Guilinyang. This is a quieter place than Holiday beach. The
best area
of Guilinyang beach is probably around the Crown Plaza hotel.
