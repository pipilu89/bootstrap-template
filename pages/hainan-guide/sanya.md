## Sanya
Sanya is the second largest city, after Haikou, in Hainan. It is situated on the southern most tip of the island. Central Sanya has a population of around 150,000. If you include the surrounding area the population is more like 400,000. This population includes Han, Hui, Miao, and Li nationalities. Sanya is the main tourist area on Hainan. You can divide Sanya into 3 areas: Sanya city, Dadonghai Bay, and Yalong Bay.

**Yalong Bay**

This is a beautiful semi-private bay and home to the most expensive hotels. The hotels here tend to be 4 and 5 star. Even if you are not staying at one of the posh hotels, it is worth coming to this area and having a stroll around the beautifully landscaped beach front resorts. However there are no restaurants, shops or bars here apart from the hotel ones.

**Dadonghai Bay**

Dadonghai is not as attractive Yalong, but there are many cheaper budget hotels, including a youth hostel. You can get a room in the cheaper hotels for 100+ RMB.  One advantage of Dadonghai is that there are many restaurants, shops and bars here. There is a bus that runs between Dadonghai and Yalong every 30 minutes. It costs 5 RMB. You can also get a taxi which should cost around 50 RMB.

**Water Activities**

You can take part in many water activities in Sanya including jet-skiing, sailing, snorkling, paragliding, and scuba diving. The waters around Sanya are clear on a calm day and there are coral reefs with some tropical fish and so is a good  place for diving. You can do a half hour beginners scuba dive with your own instructor (Chinese speaking) for around 250 RMB. There are also a few companies that do full PADI courses.
