## Qionghai

This area, centred on the city of Qionghai (Hainanese Heng Hai, pronounced "Heng High"), is emerging as a rival to the Southeast Coast (namely Xinglong Hot Springs), siphoning off some of the tourist traffic (especially Chinese tourist groups) that makes its way single-mindedly from Haikou to Sanya.

**Boao Town**

Boao is a small beach-side town in Hainan. It is roughly half way down Hainan's East coast, near to Qionghai City.

Boao (Hainanese Bak Ngao, pronounced "Buck Gow") wins a lot of local traffic on the strength of its role as permanent site of the Boao Forum for Asia. Recognising Boao's distinctive dynamic, the Hainan provincial government has now more than doubled the area of the "Boao Aquapolis", expanding it southward to take in the coastal beaches of Wanning city.

This is the Sea Story Bar on Boao beach. The bar is decorated with wood from old local wooden boats and washed up coral.
