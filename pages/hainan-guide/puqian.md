## Doubing Tower

Doubing Tower (斗柄塔) is located around 7km north of Puqian Town in the north-west of Wenchang County on Qixing Ridge. Originally built in 1625 as a landmark for incoming ships, it is one of the oldest structures in Hainan.

You can climb the narrow stairs to get a view from the top. No entrance ticket required.
