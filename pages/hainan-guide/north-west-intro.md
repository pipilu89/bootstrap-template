## North West Hainan

This covers Danzhou (locally known as Nada), Lingao, Chenmai, and Dingan Counties.

The most prominent attraction in Danzhou is the ancient Dongpo Academy of Classical Learning, established in memory of the celebrated Song dynasty Chinese poet Su Dongpo, who was exiled here by the government. The main language spoken in much of this area is Linggao, not Hainanese.
