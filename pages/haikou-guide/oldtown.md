## Haikou Qilou Acrade Street

The unique decaying architecture of the old centre of Haikou is a mix European and Asian style. It was built by returning overseas Chinese. The area roughly expands from the bridge at the end of Renmin Dadao (人民大道) to East Lake (Dong Hu, 东湖). Explore the area and hutong alleys and you will get a taste of real traditional Haikou life. There are many small shops and real life community temples hidden in the back alleys.

There is an interesting food market street at Dongmen (East gate, 东门). This market street can be found on Boai Lu (博爱路). Expect to see a vast array of dried seafood, fake antiques, and many animals from Cobra snakes to turtles on sale for food.

The old town is being renovated and made into a national tourist attraction, particularly around Zhongshan Lu (中山路).

**Getting There:**

Walk: 15 minutes. Head south down Renmin Dadao, cross over the bridge and the road into the old section.

Bicycle: A good way to explore the area because you can easily cover a lot of ground, stopping and turning as you please. 10 minutes by bike to get to old town.

Bus: Catch either 20, 26, 30, or 5 from opposite side of the road, outside the hostel. Get off at the Bell Tower (zhong lou 钟楼), then go across the street.



### Arcade Houses

'Arcade house' (骑楼 qílóu) is a term used for buildings where the front half extends out over the footpath or sidewalk. A row of such houses creates a long shaded arcade along the side of the street where pedestrians can walk sheltered from the elements. From a distance qilou bear a resemblance to the diaojiaolou (吊脚楼) of western Hunan, where the rear part of the house is built over water.

The arcade house is a particular style of building combining the characteristics of European and Southeast Asian architecture. This subtle blend of architectural elements has its own peculiar style and cultural atmosphere.

The existing arcade houses in Haikou were largely built by Hainanese returning from overseas during the 1920s and 1930s and are concentrated around five old streets: Bo'ai Lu, Zhongshan Lu, Xinhua Beilu, Deshengsha, and Changdi Lu. This area remains one of the liveliest commercial districts of Haikou to this day.

The old commercial quarter has whole streets of decaying arcade houses still in use.

From around the 1923 Haikou's trade started to flourish, particularly with other south-east Asian countries. Haikou become a busy port. The clock tower was built to provide a standard time piece to facilitate trade for all the merchants, customs officials and the transport infrastructure.
