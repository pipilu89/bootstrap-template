## Boat Builders Linggao

Location: Diaolou Town (调楼镇), Linggao County.

A guest from New Zealand was interested in Hainan wooden junk boats, so we set about finding some wooden boat builders on Hainan. One of the places we found was a small fishing port town called Diaolou Town (调楼镇) in Linggao County. They build large wooden fishing boats using largely traditional methods. One of the reasons we were interested is because this boat building craft has pretty much disappeared from developed countries. The hard-wood used in these boats generally comes from Malaysia. The town itself is unremarkable expect for the density of Sea God temples next to the busy port.
