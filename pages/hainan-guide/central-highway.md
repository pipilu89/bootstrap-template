## Driving the Central Highway 

**Part 1**

Decided to take the long way back from Sanya to Haikou. Drove along the central ‘highway’ which takes you through the mountainous centre of Hainan Island. The scenery was incredible. The road is very winding and goes up and down the mountains and gives rise to some great views. It passes through some towns and many small villages. You can spot simple buildings constructed from mud and wood. I believe these belong to some of the minorities of Hainan. Had a quick stop at WuZhiShan and also made a slight detour to BaiHua Waterfall. It had started to rain a little and so the path leading up alongside the waterfall was wet. Unfortunately this seemed to be the signal for leeches to appear. Removing them from feet and ankles was not a pleasant experience. Must return to BaiHua Waterfall on a dry day. Overall the journey was fantastic and certainly worth the extra time. No trip to Hainan would be complete without a journey through the centre.

**Part 2**

This time on the way back from Sanya to Haikou I turned left off the central highway at ShiYun and headed towards HongKan Waterfall. The mountain formations around here were spectacular. There were some good looking waterfalls in the valley below and a couple of very large waterfalls at HongKan. No road led to them and there wasn’t even an obvious foot trail so we had to admire them from a distance. Will have to return to this spot when I have a few days spare and attempt a hike to the base of the waterfalls, hopefully the jungle won’t be too thick.

**Part 3 - Sandao Area**

Spent a few days in the south of Hainan exploring the area around Sandao town (三道镇, Sān dào zhèn). We found some new bicycle and kayak routes. The Hekou river which feeds into the Chitian reservoir was particularly fun to explore. We found old broken dams and some fun roads that lead the back way into the Yanoda Tropical Rainforest Park.
