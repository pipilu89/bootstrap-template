## Xincun Town Bay 新村镇 

Xincun is a small town in Lingshui County. The peninsula provides a protected bay where many fisherman have set up home. Some have built floating houses and restaurants. 

The peninsula is also the location of the popular tourist attraction Nanwan Monkey Island. The cable cars that can be seen in some photos lead across the water to Monkey Island.
