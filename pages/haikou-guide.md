Haikou is a fairly large tropical city and the capital of Hainan. It is the business and transport centre of the island and a major port. It is a relaxed kind of place. Expect long breaks around lunch time and for shops to be open till late in the evening. Indeed Haikou is perhaps at its most lively at 10pm in the evening with many people outside along the streets eating, drinking and shopping.

Haikou city has many faces: Palm tree lined streets; modern skyscraper city scapes; traditional chinese Hutongs; bustling fishing ports/markets; and long beaches. As a major city, it has all modern facilities including bars, night-clubs, banks that accept foreign cards, and good transport links.

Wonder along HaiDian river and see the local traditional wooden fishing boats. Head to the east end of the river at around 5pm to see the fish markets. The old town centre retains a fast disappearing part of Chinese history - the Hutong. Spend an hour or 2 here getting lost amongst the winding narrow alleyways and temples of this tradition housing style. Stroll with the locals along the bustling fruit and food stalls on Haidian San Xi Lu in the evening and stop for a snack of 'chao bing'.

### Holiday Beach (假日海滩 Jiàrì hǎitān)

To the west of Haikou city, Holiday Beach stretches for over 10km. This is the main beach in Haikou. In the summer we suggest visiting in the late afternoon to avoid the mid-day heat and staying until after sunset. The central area attracts a lot of locals in late afternoon, but it is easy to escape the crowds, if you wish, by walking a bit further down the beach.

You can swim in the sea and have a go on the jet-skis (15 minutes costs 70 rmb, though your probably have to haggle on the price).

In the main area of the beach there are outdoor street food stalls and places to buy drinks. There is a nice new swimming pool and hot spring, the price starts at 28 RMB for the swimming pool. You need to pay a little bit more to use the hot spring.

To the west of the main entrance there are volley ball nets and an outdoor BBQ area. Bring your own food to the BBQ. You pay around 50 RMB for charcoal and to use the one of the BBQ pits. The BBQ pits can be very popular in the evening with locals and can provide an atmospheric setting: with the smell of good food, many people having fun, and a nice sunset on the palm tree lined beach.

### Guilinyang Beach (桂林洋海滩 Guìlínyáng hǎitān)

To the east of Haikou is the beach area of Guilinyang. This is a quieter place than Holiday beach. The best area of Guilinyang beach is probably around the Crown Plaza hotel.
