## Haikou Volcano Park

13,000 years ago, northern Hainan was the scene of extensive volcanic eruptions. The rich volcanic resources left by these eruptions gave the area its fertile soils, the strange shapes of its volcanic remnants, its lava caves, its valuable igneous rocks, and its abundant tropical ecology. This geologic event was critical in moulding the scenery and culture of the area today.

Just to the south-west of Haikou City is a protected national geological and historical site several kilometers squared in size. There are several points of interest here. The landscape is dotted with small volcanoes, there are 2 lava caves (the largest of which is 3 kilometers long), old villages built entirely from lava rock, and scenic terraced tropical farmland.

The best way to explore the area is by bicycle if you can cycle that far (60km+ for the round trip). However it is not easy to find all the points of interest independently due to lack of signs and decent maps, but it is possible if you speak Chinese.

### Měi shè Village 美社村

In 2008 the village appeared in the "top ten cultural villages of Hainan."

In the center of this once stronghold village, is its "history card": a gun tower named "Fuxing building (Fú xìng lóu 福兴楼)". This is an impressive five-storey stone tower. The passage of time is evident through the rain-stained walls; with moss that tracks the sun; and a few bullet holes and scars caused by artillery fire and aircraft bombing from when the Japanese invaded Hainan, leaving indelible marks that deepen the mystery of the tower. The tower was built in 1927 and is about 20 meters high. It was built with funds raised by the villagers. It’s purpose was to protect the village from gangs of thieving criminals.

The tower was built during a chaotic time, when there was little law and order in rural areas. It was common for bandits to steal the village cattle, sheep and grab other possessions, so Meishe village united with their money to build a resistance effort.

The village contains many examples of the old lava rock buildings that characterize this area. But unique to this village are a few new lava rock homes built to modern standards.

Meishe is a progressive village has been awarded the "virtues of the farm demonstration sites", the "safe home model village", "provincial standard range of ecological village point of civilization," municipal "non-toxic Village" and "zero domestic violence village" and so on. If you have the opportunity to visit the volcano countryside, the may wish to take a look at Meishe village to experience the history, village community, civilization and modernity.

### Róng táng Village 荣堂村 & Caves 洞穴 dòngxuè

Another surprise in the Volcano Park area, is a stone village called Rong Tang Village. Rong Tang Village is about 400 meters north of the town government office in Shishan Town. The entire village is made of volcanic rock and is about 800 years old. The village houses, walls, roads, shrines, and tombs, are all built from the abundant volcanic rock, creating a unique village landscape. The village is a historic example of making the most of local resources.

The village is situated at the entrance of a cave system. There is also another cave hidden on the north side of the Haikou Bybass Road.

The village is well preserved. Most village residents have moved out, only a few elderly people remain. Give the the elderly a few RMB to be a guide.

### Rúfú Village 儒符 and Rúfú Pagoda Ruins 儒符石塔 Rúfú shítǎ

The Rufu Pagoda was built in the Song Dynasty around 800 years ago. Today, just the base still stands. It is one of the oldest structures in Hainan. It was built entirely from volcanic rock and its style is rare in China. The design has influences from perhaps India or other south-east Asian countries.

### Leihu Volcano

LeiHu Volcano 雷虎岭, also called "Group of Autumn Hill" 群秋岭, is about 18 kilometers south from the urban area of Haikou, about 3 km south from Yongxing town, has an elevation of 170 meters and covers an area of about 0.44 square kilometers of green farmland and forest. It is long ago dormant and is largely untouched and wild apart from some cultivated farm terraces. You are unlikely to see anyoine else there apart from a few local farmers.

The area is connected by small concrete roads between the villages and farmland which are good for cycling. The fields are defined by low walls hand made from the lava rock.

Ten thousand years ago Lei Huling was created by the eruption of a volcano, the top central ridge is a much bigger than Ma'anling volcano (the site of the Haikou Tourist Volcano Park). Unlike Ma'anling volcano, this is not a complete circular volcano mouth, its like a natural big chair in shape: East and west ridges for the arms of the chair, the South Ridge for the chair backrest, north side is the open front of the gaint chair.

Located on the west side of LeiHu Volcano is LeiHu Temple 雷虎岭庙, built in the Song Dynasty, it has a history of over one thousand years, the main deity is "White Horse Temple liang" 白马梁公.

Next to the Temple is a lava cave. The local villagers call it the "Fairy Cave" 仙人洞. It is one of the largest caves in Hainan. The cave is big enough to drive a car into it. Its said the Japanese had used the cave as a large munitions warehouse during the invasion. There is a another cave somewhere around the volcano that I was unable to find.

In addition, Lei Huling has a natural spring well called the "Confucian autumn well" 儒秋井. It has a depth of about 8 meters, and a large oval opening. Supposedly providing quality natural mineral water.
