## Wanquan River Rafting And Abseiling

There is a Chinese company who provide several outdoor adventure activities such as abseiling and rafting. You can expect to see a beautiful inland area of Hainan. You will be taken along the river to a spot in the jungle where you will abseil down waterfalls, swim in lagoons, and jump from rocks into the deep pools below.  You can also raft down the river past minority villages, dense tropical jungle and Betel Nut plantations.

_**Review of a trip to the Wanquan Activity Centre**_

> I wasn't sure what to expect from the organisation but it turned out to be an excellent day.

> The area is fairly remote and the river is surrounded by tropical jungle, lots of Betel Nut plantations and small mountains. There are also a number of waterfalls feeding into the river.

> The guides were friendly and seemed to be having fun themselves. We took a boat upstream and followed a steep trail through the jungle. We abseiled down a crevasse into the stream below and worked our way down the stream. This involved a combination of jumping into lagoons, floating/swimming through pools and sliding down wooden poles. We arrived at the top of a large waterfall. It looked even higher when peering over from the top. Abseiling down through the waterfall was an excellent new experience for me, pausing half way down to look around and take in the moment. Everyone was buzzing from the mixture of adrenaline and picturesque tropical environment.

> After a late lunch we rafted for an hour or two down the river. The river was fairly calm so this certainly wasn’t white water rafting. However it was livened up by the water-fight with the group of random Locals who happened to be rafting at the same time.
