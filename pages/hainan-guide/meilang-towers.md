## Meilang Twin Pagodas

The twin pagodas were built in the early Yuan Dynasty, dating back over 800 years.

They were built to commemorate a local villager's two daughters. One of the daughters married and the other become a Buddhist nun.

The pagodas are beautifully carved, decorated with Buddha, lotus petal, elephant, lion, unicorn, tiger, unicorn, horse and auspicious patterns. They are both around 13 metres tall. They  are amongst the best preserved Yuan Dynasty towers in Hainan and protected at the state level.
