## West Hainan

The West Coast and South-West Coast of Hainan is one of the least travelled places on the island. Poor and left behind by development on other parts of Hainan, somehow it occurs to very few people to come and have a look. Which, for some, is all the more reason you should want to! Western Hainan is inhabited mainly by the Li (Hlai)  minority and has its own brand of natural beauty, including some of Hainan's only remaining virgin forests. Includes Changjiang, Dongfang, and Ledong Counties.

**Places of interest:**

- Jianfeng Ridge and Forest Reserve.
- Bawang Nature Reserve, home of the Hainan gibbon.
- Exian Mountain (俄贤领)
- Daguangba reservoir (大广坝水库 dàguǎngbà shuǐkù)



**Dongfang City**

Dongfang is located on the west coast of Hainan. It has an industrial port used to transport the ore mined from surrounding area.

In the 1940s there was a Japanese POW camp here, holding Chinese, Austrailian, and Dutch prisoners:

**Emperor cave (皇帝洞 Huángdì dòng) & Wangxia Underground Palace (王下地下宫 Wángxià dìxià gōng)**

Emperor cave is a large limestone cave, 60 kilometers from the county capital Changjiang. Extending from west to east, the entrance is 60 meters wide, about 130 meters deep, 25 meters high, covering about 7,800 square meters. It can accommodate thousands of people. Inside the cave are colorful stalactites and shapes. Archaeological experts have collected Neolithic artifacts from inside the cave, some are displayed at the Hainan Museum in Haikou. Outside, the cave is surrounded by mountains, range upon range of peaks, and the Nanyao river. The Underground Palace is also a karst cave with strange stalactite shapes and colours.

**Nanyao River (南尧河 Nányáo hé)**

The second largest tributary of the important Changhua River. Length of 41 kilometers, drainage area of 371 square kilometers, with a total drop of 1347 meters. Nanyao river is very scenic because it runs through a karst valley (hence the abundance of caves in the area). Part of the river is known locally as 'Mural Corridor' (十画长廊) because of the colourful karst cliffs towering over the river.

**Qicha Township Kapok Trees (七叉乡木棉 Qīcha xiāng Mùmián)**

Qicha Township is just west of the national park and has many farm terraces and Kopok trees. Kapok, or Ceiba pentandra, is an emergent tree of tropical rainforests. It can grow up to 70m tall. It flowers red and orange in the spring.

**Qicha Hotspring (七叉温泉)**

From Changjiang head to Qicha Town. About 1 m after the fork in the road you can school the secondary school. About 50m further down on the right is a 40sqm outdoor pond. The natural spring may not be clean or suitable for use.
