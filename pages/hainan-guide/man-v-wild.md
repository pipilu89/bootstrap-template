## Hainan Jungle on Discovery Channel's Man v Wild TV Show

The Discovery Channel's TV series 'Man vs Wild with Bear Grylls' filmed an episode in late 2009 about survival in the Southern Chinese jungle. Although never mentioned in the episode, it was actually filmed in the central area of Hainan. Central Hainan is the least developed part of the island and some areas are still thick with jungle and rainforest.

Judging by the scenery, I believe some of it was filmed around Wanquan river. I recognise some of the scenery from the Wanquan Outdoor Activity Centre. The centre does a jungle exploration activity that will take you to some of areas seen in this video.
