## Haikou Parks

These are the main parks in Haikou:

- Baishamen (白沙门 White Sand Beach). A park built next to the beach.
- Shiji Gongyuan (世纪公园 Century Park), located on the coast next to Century Bridge.
- Wanlu Yuan (万绿园 Thousands Green park).
- Renmin Gongyuan (人民公园 People's Park), next to East Lake.
- Jinniuling Yuan (金牛岭公园 Golden Bull Mountain-Peak park).
- Wuyuan He Gongyuan (五源河公园 Wuyuan River Wetlands Park), a wetlands park near Holiday Beach.
- Meishe He Gongyuan (美舍河凤翔湿地公园 Meishe Wetlands Park), south of city on Yehai Dadao.

Wan Lu Yuan has more large open green areas, whereas Jin Niu has more winding paths and thick tropical vegetation. Join the locals on a sunny afternoon at Wan Lu Yuan flying a kite (can be bought for a few RMB at the gate) and playing badminton.

If your interested in Tai Chi (Taijiquan), push hands, or other martial arts then go Renmin Park in the morning before 11.00am. Haikou residents practice most days at the park.

Renmin park also has wood carving stalls next to East Lake on weekends. You can see examples of the traditional Chinese art form that involves carving tree stumps.

Baishamen is close to the Banana Hostel, about 1.5 km away on the north coast.

### Century Park

A new coastal cycle path connects Haikou Clock Tower to this Park, the path continues on to Evergreen Park. Century Park has football pitches, basketball courts and a running track that is ope to the public. In 2021 the Wormhole Library opened within the park. The library has a very distinctive design.
