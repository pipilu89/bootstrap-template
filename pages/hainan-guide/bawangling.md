The Hainan Gibbon is considered to be the world's rarest ape. Numbers are around 20-30.

Back in 2003 Seacology.org (a nonprofit organisation) started a program to protect the Hainan Gibbons at Bawangling Reserve. They persuaded local villages to protect the Gibbon habitat by offering scholarships to village children.
