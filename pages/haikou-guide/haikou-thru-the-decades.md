## Overview of Haikou city

This photo from the 1970s shows Haikou is little more than the present old town area. The photo was taken looking north to south. In the centre we can see the East Lake. Towards the top of the photo you can just about make out the old Haikou Airport (present day Guoxing Avenue 国兴大道). In the bottom of the photo we can see Haidian Island and Renmin Bridge. At this time the rest of Haidian Island is mainly fields and water.

## Haidian Island

This photo is from the early 1980s, looking north over Renmin Bridge, across Haidian Island. Renmin road construction has started. Haidian Island is mostly fields, rivers, and a few buildings.

Later that decade in 1987 Haidian Island has changed alot. Haidian Bridge has become a busy road. Haidian 1, 2 and 3 roads have all grown dramatically. Most of present day Hainan University is still water and fields. Haidian 5 and 6 roads still don't exist. Baishamen Park is still along way ahead in the furture, it was built around 2008.

Haidian 2 road, 3 road etc do not exist yet.

## Binhai Avenue and Longkun Road

Binhai Avenue was constructed in 1965 by government mobilized citizens. Originally made from soil, in 1973 it became an asphalt road. Then from 1984 to 1988 it was expanded into a 3 lane road.

This photo from the early 1980s shows Binhai Avenue was very close to the seashore (hence its name, which means besides the sea in Chinese).
