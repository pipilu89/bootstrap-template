## Taxis

Taxis are plentiful in Haikou and are an easy way to get around. The metered fare is 10 RMB for the first 3km and 2 RMB per additional km.

Nowadays, Uber style taxi services are the most common. DiDi (滴滴出行) is the local equivalent of Uber. If you have Wechat app on your phone you can use DiDi from the mini apps within Wechat to order a taxi.
