Haikou Hostel is located in the North-East of Haikou City. We are on a large island called Haidian Dao (海甸岛).

We are located down an alley on Renmin Avenue (Chinese: Renmin Dadao 人民大道).

We are near to where Renmin Ave and San Lu (海甸三路) cross. On one corner of this crossing there is a Kentucky Fried Chicken. On another corner is a purple China EverBright Bank.

Make sure you are on the same side of the road as the EverBright Bank. Stand outside the bank facing the entrance, then turn to your left. Walk a few metres and you will pass a row of restaurants on your right-hand side. Continue a few more metres and the next tall yellow building ground floor is a supermarket called Shixianli (食鲜里超市). In front of the supermarket is a bus stop. On the opposite side of the road there is a green China Post.

> If facing the supermarket, Haikou Banana Hostel is down the alley on the left side. Go behind the supermarket, through the carpark and we are the second building on the left hand side.

### Important information if you get a taxi:

Not all taxi drivers know about us, so it is often easier to ask for the Kentucky Fried Chicken (Chinese: KenDaJi) on Renmin Dadao in Haidian Dao.
If you can speak some Chinese all you need to say is:
Haidian Dao, Renmin Dadao, Ken Da Ji.

Another useful tip for dealing with taxi drivers is to give them the Haikou Banana Hostel reception telephone number: 0898 66286780. The taxi driver can then call the hostel to find directions. So make a note of this number.

Do not expect taxi drivers to be able to speak English!

Warning: We have heard about a taxi driver who will tell you that the Haikou Banana Hostel has closed. This is a lie. The taxi driver says this so he can take you to a different hotel where he can earn a commission. If a taxi driver says this to you do not believe him and either insist he takes you to the Banana hostel or find another taxi.
