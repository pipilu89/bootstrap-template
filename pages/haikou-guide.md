title: Haikou Guide
---

Haikou is a fairly large tropical city and the capital of Hainan. It is the business and transport centre of the island and a major port. It is a relaxed kind of place. Expect long breaks around lunch time and for shops to be open till late in the evening. Indeed Haikou is perhaps at its most lively at 10pm in the evening with many people outside along the streets eating, drinking and shopping.

Haikou city has many faces: Palm tree lined streets; modern skyscraper city scapes; traditional chinese Hutongs; bustling fishing ports/markets; and long beaches. As a major city, it has all modern facilities including bars, night-clubs, banks that accept foreign cards, and good transport links.

Wonder along HaiDian river and see the local traditional wooden fishing boats. Head to the east end of the river at around 5pm to see the fish markets. The old town centre retains a fast disappearing part of Chinese history - the Hutong. Spend an hour or 2 here getting lost amongst the winding narrow alleyways and temples of this tradition housing style. Stroll with the locals along the bustling fruit and food stalls on Haidian San Xi Lu in the evening and stop for a snack of 'chao bing'.
