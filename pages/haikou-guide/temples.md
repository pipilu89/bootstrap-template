## Haikou Temples

Haikou has many temples. The most famous is Five Officials Temple (五公祠 Wǔ gōng cí). This is a  fairly well known place on the tourist route, ticket price 20 RMB.

There are many small interesting temples that are generally not visited by tourists and do not have an entrance fee. These are real temples that are still part of the local communities. Wander off the main roads into the small hutong back alleys and your bound to find a few. If you do not like tourist places these temples may be more interesting than Five Officials Temple.
