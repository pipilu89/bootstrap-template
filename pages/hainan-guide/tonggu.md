## Tonggu Ling & Yue Liang Bay

Tonggu Ling (铜鼓岭) is the name of a small mountain and is a protected reserve on the North-East coast of Hainan. YueLiang Bay (月亮湾, Moon Bay) is a long strech of beach on the north side of the mountain.

This is an area of natural beauty. Ascend TongguLing mountain and you are rewarded with spectacular views of the surrounding beaches, sea and coconut forest. The sea is clean and clear and the beaches stretch as far as you can see. Wander down to the beach and you will most likely have your own 10km beach, apart from the occansional local fisherman. It is a great contrast to the developed beach resorts of Sanya. For me, this place is what Hainan is all about. Don't expect to find any signposts to this spot; to find it I used a combination of map, compass, asking locals, and trial and error. Beaware the area is starting to develop, especially since the government started contruction of a new satellite launch site in the nearby town of Longlou. There are reports that foreigners have restricted access to the area.

Tonggu Ling is a 2 hour (100km) drive south-east from Haikou. This makes it an ideal day trip from Haikou. To get there head east from Wencheng for around 50km.

Location: Part of the Tongguling Nature Reserve, East of Wenchang, Hainan Island.

This is an area we found through a trip with some local people. The area is geographically interesting due to the combination of massive rock formations, small beach coves, green countryside, and hilly terrain.

**Blog Article About Snorkeling at Stone Park**

Snorkeling as been on my list of things to do for a while. I was exploring the North-East coast of Hainan on a calm day and found a spot that looked interesting. The water had good visibility and even without any equipment I could see interesting coral and some fish.

This is when I realized the relationship between water visibility and the weather. It seems very obvious now, but it did not occur to me before. Visibility is best when there are no waves or wind. Snorkeling weather is roughly the inverse to good surf weather.

In the following few days I purchased some snorkeling equipment locally (not the greatest quality, but it will suffice for now). I also kept abreast with the swell and wind forecasts (there is a link to a good forecasting web-site at the end of this page), waiting for the right conditions.

The right day came and I had a fun day exploring the area with a few friends. Visibility was probably around 2-3 metres. We saw lots of coral and quite a few small fish. Do not try to pick up sea urchins because they can fire their spikes into your hand as a friend learnt the hard way. I think there are probably many decent spots around the island to snorkel. It’s just a matter of going out and finding them. An excellent inexpensive day out.

**Further info about Tongguling National Nature Reserve**

- Chinese name: 海南铜鼓岭国家级自然保护 Hǎinán tónggǔ lǐng guójiā jí zìrán bǎohù qū
- Location: Wenchang County (文昌)
- Key areas of protection: Coral reefs, geological features, tropical monsoon elfin forest, wild animals
- Area (ha): 4,400

Tongguling Nature Reserve is located in the north-east of Hainan. It is on the south east coast of Wenchang county, about 30 km from Wenchang Town. The geographical coordinates are E: 110 ° 58'30 "~ 111 ° 03'00", N: 19 ° 36'54 "~ 19 ° 41'21". It is about 45km sq in size, about 30km sq of which is sea.

There are about 1000 plant species, 10 species of birds and 20 kinds of reptiles, plus amphibians and insects.

A key area of protection are the shallow coral reefs. Typical reef organisms in the reserve include: scleractinian corals, coralline algae, staghorn corals, soft corals, fish, algae, mollusks, benthic organisms and other reef organisms.

Tongguling has geological features that are rare in China including the erosion of igneous rocks by both weathering and wave erosion. This results in the formation of sea cliffs, sea caves, sea niches, etc. The area is situated near a deep fault line and so historically affected by tectonic plate movement and once was volcanic.
