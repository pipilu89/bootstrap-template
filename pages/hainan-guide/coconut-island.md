## Coconut Island

Chinese name: 东郊椰林 (文昌), Dongjiao Yelin (Wenchang County).

This is a beautiful area to the south east of Wencheng. It is not really and island, but a peninsula.

The area consists of miles of nice beaches, small villages, dense green tropical vegetation and winding pathways.

Most of the area is undeveloped, but you can find some small beach resort areas. The beach resorts have medium priced accommodation, or some much cheaper guest houses can be found nearby.

Direct buses for Dongjiao leave from Haikou East and South stations, thay cost around 30 RMB and take a couple of hours.
