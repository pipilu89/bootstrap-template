*Haikou Bund Center Bar Street*

Haikou has many bars and clubs around the city. There are few different types of drinking establishments in Haikou. Here s a brief summary:

- There are a few western stlye bars that also serve food. 
- Outdoor BBQs/restaurants also have beer available so you can eat while you drink.
- Large nightclubs. These bars are decorated at the opposite end of the spectrum to the small local bars. Lots of money is spent on large flashy lights, mirrors and a large sound system. Drink prices are therefore much more exspensive. Individual drinks may cost around 20-40 RMB. Beers are more reasonable if you buy 12 at a time. A bottle of vodka will cost around 300 RMB, this may work out well if your sharing with some friends. Most clubs play fairly similar music. The more modern ones will play a mix of recent House, Hip-hop, RnB, Western Chart Pop, and Chinese songs. Most clubs have a very small dance floor and lots of tables. It is normal for slightly intoxicated Chinese to toast drinks at your table. Open from evening till late. Music is generally loud.
- At KTV bars your generally order a private room to share with your friends.
